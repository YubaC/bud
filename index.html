                            new
                            medical system called bud. You see, my little one's been growing a bit slower than
                            others,
                            and getting to a doctor, with the long trips and the bills that feel like mountains,
                            just
                            hasn't been feasible. But then I found bud. It's like a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day.
                            I
                            can manage everything right from our cozy living room. No need to take time off work, no
                            long drives to distant hospitals, and it doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. It's such a
                            relief
                            to have something that's easy to use and actually affordable. I'm really grateful for
                            how
                            it's made caring for my child simpler. It's like a helping hand at a time when I needed
                            it
                            the most. We're finally seeing some positive changes, and that's a weight off my
                            shoulders.
                            Bud's given us more than just medical help; it's given us hope, and in our little world,
                            that means everything."

                            up afterwards. But then I found this system called 'bud.' It's been a godsend, honestly.

                            can do everything from home, which means no taking off work or long trips to the city.

                            practice,
                            I am extremely excited about our trial of the bud medical system. Ever since I saw the

                            need for accessible healthcare in my hometown, I have dreamed of how to use technology to
                            improve people's health. Now, this high-tech product, which combines AI technology, has
                            shown me
                            a new possibility. Its performance is astonishing, with a quality that nearly rivals that of
                            real-life physicians in diagnostics. This not only reminds me of my passionate exploration
                            of
                            medical technology during my university days but also ignites my imagination for the future.
                            I
                            really like this system. I believe it will not only help us doctors work more effectively

                            also offer patients faster and more accurate medical services. This is exactly the goal I've

                    The BUD system is a preliminary bone age assessment platform based on deep learning technology. Due
                    to the inherent uncertainties of AI and regional differences in bone age assessment standards and
                    humans' health condition, deviations in results may occur when compared with those obtained by other
                    physicians and diagnostic equipment. Our product is not a substitute for professional pediatric
                    care, and all results should be considered for reference only. Should the assessment suggest any
                    abnormalities in your child's development, we urge you to seek further examination and professional
                    medical advice at a specialized pediatric institution. We accept no responsibility for any
                    irreversible consequences arising from self-treatment based on our system’s results.
